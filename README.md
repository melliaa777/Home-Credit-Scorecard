Home Credit Indonesia wants to create a machine learning model that can assist the team in predicting whether loans from customers will encounter difficulties in repayment or not. With the right machine learning model in place, it is hoped that it can ensure that customers who are capable of repayment are not rejected when applying for a loan, thereby increasing Home Credit Indonesia's revenue.
